## 🚀 Key Features

- **Automated Primer & Probe Design**  
  Identification of conserved genomic regions using a fast **2-bit integer encoding** strategy for scalable sequence comparison.

- **In-silico PCR Validation**  
  Screening of candidate assays against hundreds to thousands of background genomes using a *Turbo Pigeonhole*–based mismatch pruning algorithm.

- **High-Performance Parallelization**  
  Efficient utilization of all available CPU cores to accelerate candidate generation and validation.

- **Adaptive Constraint Relaxation**  
  Automatic relaxation of biological constraints when no valid primer–probe sets are found under strict parameter settings.

- **Deterministic & Reproducible**  
  Deterministic sampling ensures identical results across repeated runs given identical inputs.

- **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Native execution on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Pipeline

### 🪟 Windows
Double-click:
```
RUN_APP.bat
```
Then follow the on-screen prompts.

### 🍎 macOS / 🐧 Linux
```bash
./RUN_APP_UX.sh
```
Follow the interactive prompts.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All biological and computational parameters are configured interactively via the left control panel:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| design_target_sampling_size | 0 | Number of target genomes used for design (0 = all genomes; maximum accuracy). |
| design_max_candidates | 10 | Number of primer–probe sets evaluated per design cycle. |
| min_sensitivity | 90.0 | Minimum percentage of target genomes detected. |
| primer_length | 20 | Primer length (bp). |
| product_size_min | 100 | Minimum amplicon size (bp). |
| product_size_max | 400 | Maximum amplicon size (bp). |
| enable_blast | true | Annotate amplicons using NCBI BLAST (requires internet connection). |

## 🛠 System Requirements

- **Python ≥ 3.9**  
  Must be installed and available in the system `PATH`.

- **Internet connection (optional)**  
  Required only for genome downloading and BLAST-based annotation.

- **Hardware considerations**  
  Performance and genome capacity depend on available computational resources. On a standard desktop or laptop equipped with:
  - **16 GB RAM**
  - **Intel Core i5-9400 processor or equivalent**

  the pipeline can typically handle:
  - Up to **500 target genomes** and **500 background genomes** for **Gram-positive bacteria**
  - Up to **150 target genomes** and **150 background genomes** for **Gram-negative bacteria**

  These limits can be increased proportionally on systems with higher memory and computational capacity.
